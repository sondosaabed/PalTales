# PalTales

In response to the ongoing Israeli offensive Forces, the ethnic cleansing and aparthhied, this app emerges as a platform to illuminate our unique narrative. Palestinians are a resilient and creative people, garnering recognition through various awards in cinema and literature. The app's primary objective is to present insight into the inspiring resilience of our people and our tales.

It is offered by two services:
- List of books that delves into the Palestinian narrative.
- Collection of films, providing a visual representation of our experiences.

Over time, I have personally compiled a list of Palestinian movies and documentaries, both created by Palestinians and others, accessible through the Internet Movies Database (IMDB) which I have used in this app.
